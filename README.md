# Power-BI-Analysis-of-Sales-and-Availability-Across-Channels

**Domain:**  Hospitality       **Function:** Revenue

**Summary of the project**

This report provides an in-depth analysis of sales and availability trends across different distribution channels in the hospitality industry. It leverages Power BI to visualize key metrics, enabling stakeholders to make data-driven decisions to optimize channel performance.

**Key Metrics Analyzed:**

1.	Booking Volume: Total number of bookings across different channels.
   
3.	Revenue Performance: Revenue generated per channel, analyzed through Average Daily Rate (ADR) and Revenue per Available Room (RevPAR).
   
5.	Occupancy Rate: Percentage of available rooms sold over a given period.
   
7.	Cancellation Rate: Percentage of bookings canceled per channel.
   
9.	Lead Time: The time gap between booking and actual check-in.
    
11.	Channel Efficiency: Conversion rates and cost per booking per channel.
    
13.	Realization Rate: The percentage of booked rooms that were actually utilized.
    
15.	BRN (Booked Room Nights): Total number of room nights booked across all channels.
    
17.	URN (Utilized Room Nights): The number of room nights actually occupied.
    
19.	DSRN (Denied/Shortfall Room Nights): The number of room nights requested but not fulfilled due to unavailability.
    
21.	DBRN (Dropped Booked Room Nights): Room nights that were booked but later dropped or canceled.


**Analysis Approach:**

1. Monthly & Weekly Trends:

The report includes interactive visuals to track fluctuations in sales, revenue, and occupancy rates over weeks and months.

Seasonal trends can be identified to adjust marketing and pricing strategies.

2. Comparative Channel Performance:

Each distribution channel (e.g., direct bookings, OTAs, corporate sales, travel agents) is evaluated based on revenue contribution, booking trends, and customer behavior.

Metrics such as URN vs. BRN help assess actual room utilization and efficiency of bookings per channel.

DSRN trends highlight demand-supply gaps, helping optimize inventory allocation.

DBRN patterns can reveal issues with booking confirmations or customer cancellations.

**KPI Dashboards:**

A Power BI dashboard provides a consolidated view of key performance indicators (KPIs), with filters to drill down into specific timeframes and channel categories.

Users can dynamically switch between monthly and weekly views for deeper insights.
